          For more than 30 years, we have contributed to building a brighter
          future for artisans and their families. Through responsible and more
          sustainable design and production of interior home textiles, our focus
          has always been and always will be on celebrating artisanship.

          It all started with an idea that we could produce the traditional
          Norwegian rag rugs (“fillerye”) in Pakistan, drawing on the rich
          weaving experience of local artisans and using waste materials (rags)
          from local textile factories. Over the years, our approach has always
          been to make the most of what we have and stretch ourselves to achieve
          more and better. We have built on successes, and a few failures, and
          can today present an impressive portfolio of a wide range of home
          interior textiles, all arefully crafted by men and women who take
          pride in their work.

          To this day, we remain committed to our core values of being
          responsible, seeking truly sustainable solutions, and engaging with
          the people who make our products. Our commitment to transparency,
          sustainable business practices and to being a responsible social force
          for good remains at the core of everything we do.
